<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a driven civil engineer equipped with a B.Tech degree from Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology. I am passionate about sustainable infrastructure design and am looking to apply my skills to projects that have a positive impact on communities.</p>

<p>During my undergraduate studies, I developed proficiency in design software like AutoCAD, Revit Architecture and STAAD Pro. I executed an independent eco-friendly residential building project, demonstrating my interest in green construction practices. I also conducted pioneering research on utilizing industrial waste materials in rammed earth walls, showcasing my innovative thinking.</p>

<p>As an intern with Sai Shiv Construction Pvt. Ltd., I gained valuable hands-on experience contributing to the construction of an indoor stadium. This allowed me to apply classroom knowledge and gave insights into large-scale projects. As a graphic designer for the ICE Student Chapter, I honed my creativity and communication abilities.</p>

<p>Beyond engineering, I have a well-rounded personality. I enjoy pursuits like sketching, painting, photography and cooking. Overcoming vision disabilities as a child, I developed strong perseverance and problem-solving skills. I am now focused on building expertise in structural analysis, BIM modeling and sustainability to drive positive change through ethical engineering.</p>
